# squidgate
(needs contributors) PHP LDAP web application to manage Squid Proxy Server, you can create/add/delete squid users groups and ACL (Access Control lists), change Proxy ports.

Please do not hesitate to FORK this project.

This project is not ready for immediate use because some installation information are still missing, I am working on this. I am really sorry for this inconvenience, but this project is in its infancy. As many Git project, contributors are needed to leverage this project.

For any information and discussion with me (and proposing new ideas), please:
ala.g.abudeeb@hotmail.com

Any way, here is some fundamental component to have on your computer in order to use this application:

1--------
A working appache server

2--------
A working LDAP server

3--------
A working squid server


4--------
This LDAP directory hierarchy should be build on your local machine before you can access the application.

So the following username and password will only work after building this hiererchy, I will provide information about creating this hierarchy in a few days:

a username and a password as follows:

ID: admin
password: admin


if the password admin does not work please try

12345

if this does not work please contact me, I will provide immediate help.

.................... PLEASE NOTE .......................................

I hope you contribute with me to create a user installation guide and to enhance this project..

Take care
